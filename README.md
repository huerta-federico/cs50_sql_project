# CS50 SQL Final project

This DB was my final project submission for the CS50â€™s Introduction to Databases with SQL course offered by HarvardX.

It's built on SQLite3 and all the info about the schema, tables, relationships, etc., is described in the DESIGN.md file. Plus, there's a diagram for the tables and their different relationships.
